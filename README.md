### Hi, I'm Melany 👋🏼

> About me:

I'm interested in anything related to art 🎨 and science 🧬


I'm a very curious and creative person, currently training as a **frontend developer** which is a whole new world for me since I'm a biology student 📚 but also I'm used to research and I love to create and design, so this field allows me both 🎭
