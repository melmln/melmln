## Hi, I'm Melany ‚úåüèº

**< About me />**

I have one year of experience as a **Front-End Developer** building responsive websites, and I currently work as a freelancer. In addition, I'm learning **UX/UI Design** to enhance my development skills and improve the user experience in terms of design and usability. As a person who is both creative and logical, I am drawn to this career path because it allows me to use both aspects of my personality, which I thoroughly enjoy ü§ì.
